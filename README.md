# InputAnalyzer-adjusted-Estlack-2021-git

This is an early attempt at an audio reactive graphic animation display. Right now, I am working to set it up so I can read audio inputs from a MacBook Pro's microphone. The InputAnalyzer (authored by Richard Eakin) takes the signal and produces a live graphic display of FFT using MonitorSpectralNode. 

Building on this initial Sample, I'm looking to pull values from changes in FFT and SpectralNode, and trigger graphic animations (or other OpenGL, Metal) events.
